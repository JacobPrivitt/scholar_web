# CScholar_Web

This program was inspired by my girlfriend. She would go through pages of forums for scholarships just to realize that she did not qualify for the scholarship.
Hopefully this will be a easy one-stop shop for finding the scholarships that you can actually get.
Will more than likely make this an open project so others can contribute.

I would make it in html, for better web access but I am not great at html so if anyone would like to help with that, that would be swell.

Thanks,

Jacob
